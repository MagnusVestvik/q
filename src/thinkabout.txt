in rust code is organized by what it does.
ie a filename should be what does the code in this file accomplish
it does not separate concerns, this however does not mean you should not separate concerns
it simply means that rust gives you a way to separate concerns in the same file by
defining modules, thsi is the idiomatic way to write rust
